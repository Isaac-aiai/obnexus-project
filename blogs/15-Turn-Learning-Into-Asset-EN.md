# Why Armies Write Battle Reports After Every Fight

---

## Ancient Wisdom

Ancient armies wrote battle reports after every fight, win or lose.

Detailed records: when troops deployed, which route taken, how many enemies, our casualties, which decisions were right, which were wrong.

You might think: fight's over, why bother recording all this?

The usefulness is huge.

Three years later, facing a similar enemy, pull out that old battle report — how it was fought, what pitfalls existed, what tactics worked — it's all there.

Ten years later, a new general takes command. No need to figure everything out from scratch. Study the historical battle reports, inherit all the experience of predecessors.

**Battle reports aren't records. They're assets.**

They turn one-time battle experience into organizational knowledge that can be used again and again.

## Knowledge Is Volatile

After finishing this AI Agent project, I had a worry:

**Three months from now, will I still remember any of this?**

Things I spent weeks learning: how to design Config, how to switch Engines, how to register Tools, how to handle circular dependencies...

I remember it all now. But three months later? Six months?

Ever had this experience:

- Finished a book, felt like you gained so much at the time. Six months later someone asks "what was that book about," you can only describe a vague feeling
- Solved a hard problem, researched tons of material at the time. Three months later, similar problem, you're researching all over again

**Knowledge lives in the brain, but the brain isn't a hard drive.** It forgets. Gets confused. Reorganizes.

Having learned doesn't mean remembering. Remembering doesn't mean being able to use it.

## Documentation Is Solid

But documentation is different.

Documentation is written down. It doesn't forget, doesn't change, doesn't evaporate.

Three months later I forget how to configure `remote_postgres_engine`? No problem, open the docs, it's all there clearly.

Six months later I forget why I chose NeonDB over RDS? No problem, open the docs, the reasoning process is recorded.

Like battle reports. The general might forget details of that battle three years ago, but open the battle report, everything's there.

**Documentation is knowledge in solid form.**

## From Process to Asset

There's a mindset shift here:

> **Learning is process. Documentation is asset.**

Processes end. These weeks of learning will someday be "learned." What then? If nothing's left behind, then the process really was just a process — gone once it's over.

But if you write what you learned into documentation, things change.

Documentation **accumulates**. Learn something new, that's one more document. More time passes, more accumulates.

Documentation is **reusable**. Hit a similar problem later, just check your own docs. No re-Googling, no re-discovering pitfalls.

Documentation is **showable**. Can be pulled out in interviews. Can be shared on GitHub. It proves you didn't just "study it" — you actually understand it.

Same logic as military battle reports:

- Fight a battle, gain a battle report (accumulation)
- Similar situation arises, reference old battle reports (reuse)
- New general takes over, studies historical battle reports (transfer)

**Battle reports turn one-time battle experience into permanent organizational assets. Documentation does the same.**

## AI Makes Writing Documentation Easy

Writing documentation used to be painful.

Code's done, now you have to go back and explain what each function does, why it's designed this way, how to configure and use it...

Just thinking about it is exhausting. So most people say "later," and then there is no later.

But now we have AI.

AI can help quickly generate documentation drafts:

1. Show it the code
2. Tell it what kind of documentation you want
3. Review what it writes, modify and supplement

Goes from "writing from scratch" to "reviewing and editing." Cost drops 80%.

Like armies adopting a scribe system: general dictates the battle situation, scribe records and organizes, general reviews and signs. General's time goes to "explaining what happened clearly," not "writing every character by hand."

**Lower the barrier, remove the excuse.**

## A Habit Suggestion

One habit I learned from this project:

**Record while doing. Organize periodically.**

Specifically:

1. Learn something new, spend 10 minutes jotting it down (doesn't need to be complete, key points are enough)
2. Solve a hard problem, record the cause and solution
3. Weekly or at the end of each phase, use AI to organize scattered notes into formal documentation

No need to write perfect documentation from the start. Raw material first, polished output later.

Like battle reports: on the battlefield there are scouts' real-time updates, after battle it gets organized into formal reports.

## Takeaway for Product People

If you work in product, same logic applies.

Every project, every research effort, every user interview is "a battle."

Fight and forget? Or write it down, turn it into team knowledge assets?

- What did this user research reveal?
- Why was this feature designed this way?
- We hit this pitfall, how do we avoid it next time?

Write it down, and it becomes reusable experience.

Don't write it, and it's just memory in one person's head — memory that will slowly fade.

## Personal Reflection

Finishing this project, technical skills were one kind of gain.

But more important might be this habit: **write down what you learn.**

Write it down, and it becomes your asset.

Don't write it, and it's just memory that will disappear.

Time passes, but documentation remains.

**That's what "really learned it" means.**
